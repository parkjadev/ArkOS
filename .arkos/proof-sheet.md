## What ArkOS governance guarantees

1. Every change has an EARS-based, testable, traceable spec.
2. Every architecturally significant decision has an ADR.
3. Every feature touching personal data has a privacy review (APP 1, 5, 11).
4. Every feature crossing a trust boundary has a STRIDE-lite threat model.
5. Every release ships with a CycloneDX SBOM and clean SAST and dependency report.
6. Every PR is gated by CI for lint, typecheck, tests, accessibility, and contracts.
7. Every release updates a Keep-a-Changelog CHANGELOG.md.

## Run readiness checklist

Complete this checklist before promoting to production. CI cannot automate all run gate criteria.

- [ ] SLOs are defined in the runbook with numeric targets
- [ ] Runbook covers health checks, common alerts, and rollback procedure
- [ ] Structured logging is wired; one metric per SLO; one alert per failure mode
- [ ] On-call rotation is recorded in the runbook

## Out of scope for this version

IRAP; Essential Eight ML2+; SLSA L3+; ISO 27001 full ISMS; SOC 2 Type II.

These are available in later versions of ArkOS or as a separately scoped engagement through ARK360.
